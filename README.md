## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior and predict customer churn for an ecommerce platform. The project involves multiple stages, including data analysis, data cleaning, machine learning model development, and project deployment.

## Data Analysis with Power BI

In the initial phase, we used Power BI to perform exploratory data analysis on the customer data. This allowed us to gain insights into customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and potential factors contributing to churn. Visualizations and dashboards were created to present the findings in an interactive and informative manner.

## Data Cleaning with Python

Following the data analysis, the raw data was preprocessed and cleaned using Python. This involved handling missing values, data transformation, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for machine learning model training.

## Machine Learning for Churn Prediction

Machine learning algorithms were employed to build a predictive model for customer churn. We used techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to train and evaluate the model's performance. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were applied to ensure the model's reliability.

## Project Deployment

The machine learning model was deployed to a production environment using a web framework. Users can input relevant customer data, and the model will provide predictions on whether a customer is likely to churn or not.
